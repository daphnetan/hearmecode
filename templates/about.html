    <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Why I started Hear Me Code</h2>

    <p>In theory, I love going to tech events. But I got tired of being one of the only women in in the room.  Not only did I feel like I didn't belong, but I often felt that others were talking down to me and not taking me seriously.</p>

    <p>When I talked to the other women at these events, I realized that it wasn't just me.  We all had this shared experience - feeling isolated, intimidated, unwelcome. It's no wonder that most women didn't come back for a second event.</p>

    <p>Many women came to these events to learn more and to get experience to break into the field, but were being pushed out and turned away.</p>

    <p>Bottom line, the tech industry isn't using its full talent base -- and there are so many people not yet at the table, with their voices unheard and their ideas unimplemented.</p>

    <p>Hear Me Code is my attempt to address the gender disparity in tech, and in so doing, empower others to create the change they wish to see.</p>
